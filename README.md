# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that introduces basic concepts and workflows in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The notebook demonstrates how text data can be processed, analyzed, and modeled using Python libraries.

## Contents

- Overview of NLP and its applications  
- Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and stopword removal  
- Feature extraction methods for representing text numerically  
- Simple examples of applying machine learning models to text data  

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
3. Run the cells step by step to understand the workflow and experiment with the code.  

## Notes

- The notebook is intended for educational purposes and provides a foundation for learning NLP.  
- You can extend the examples with more advanced techniques or larger datasets.
